# Smart-Shoes
New fitness trackers and smartwatches are released to the consumer market every year. These devices are equipped with different sensors, algorithms, and accompanying mobile apps. The goal of these devices is to collect physical activity data that can be used as an addition to existing methods for health data collection in research. Furthermore, data collected from these devices have possible applications in patient diagnostics and treatment. But not everyone has the purchasing power to buy these fitness trackers and smartwatches just to keep track of their physical activities and health quantifiers. We propose the use of shoes which are universally worn and available, to be embedded with processors, sensors and digital communication technologies to enable the user to track their fitness records and enable them to view the metrics using a projector embedded in the shoe. This project aims to provide a proof of concept for this technology.

Please refer to the report for pin diagram and configuration and to understand the overall architecture of the project. The working demo is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu11YmZ3leQ&t=78s
